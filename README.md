 The KNN Technique It is a nonparametric, supervised ML technique commonly applied to pattern recognition . It is predicated on the nearest neighbor rule, which is applied in ML applications to classify data. This method involves training the test pattern using the classifier, and then classifying the test pattern according to how similar it is to each training pattern. The KNN classifier produces a class membership value that it is a member of. The object is allocated to the most widely used class labels among its k-nearest neighbors based on the plurality vote of its neighbors. It functions similarly to an instance-based learning model, with locally approximated operations and distinct computations throughout the classification process.
